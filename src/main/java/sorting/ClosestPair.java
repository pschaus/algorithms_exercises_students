/**
 * Let a be an array of integers. In this exercise we are interested in finding
 * the two entries i and j such that a[i] + a[j] is the closest from a target x.
 * In other words, there are no entries k,l such that |x - (a[i] + a[j])| > |x - (a[k] + a[l])|.
 * Note that we can have i = j.
 * Your program must return the values a[i] and a[j].
 *
 * For example let a = [5, 10, 1, 75, 150, 151, 155, 18, 75, 50, 30]
 *
 * then for x = 20, your program must return the array [10, 10],
 *      for x = 153 you must return [1, 151] and
 *      for x = 170 you must return [18, 151]
